## Description
This is a simple and clean CV (Curriculum Vitae) created using only **HTML tags**, without any CSS styling or font tags. It demonstrates semantic HTML structure for building a professional resume.

## Files
- **index.html** - Main CV document containing personal information, work experience, education, skills, and certifications
- **placeholderimage.png** - Profile photo displayed at the top of the CV (width: 100px)

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
